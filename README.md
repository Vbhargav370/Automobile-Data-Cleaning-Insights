# Automobile-Data-Cleaning-Insights

I recently worked on a data analysis project using Pandas, where I performed data cleaning, filtering, and transformations on a dataset. Here are some of the key tasks I accomplished:

🔹 Commands Used:
✅ import pandas as pd → Importing the Pandas library
✅ pd.read_csv() → Loading the dataset
✅ head() → Displaying the first few rows
✅ shape → Checking the number of rows & columns
✅ isnull().sum() → Identifying missing values
✅ fillna() → Filling null values with the column mean
✅ value_counts() → Finding unique values & their occurrences
✅ isin() → Filtering data based on conditions
✅ apply() → Applying functions to modify data

🔹 Key Data Cleaning Tasks Performed:
1️⃣ Handling Missing Values: Replaced null values with the column mean.
2️⃣ Understanding Data Distribution: Checked the count of unique car makes in the dataset.
3️⃣ Filtering Data: Extracted all records where Origin is either Asia or Europe.
4️⃣ Removing Unwanted Records: Deleted rows where Weight was greater than 4000.
5️⃣ Applying Functions: Increased all values in the MPG_City column by 3.

💡 This project helped me strengthen my skills in Pandas for data manipulation and preprocessing.

🚀 Excited to explore more advanced data analysis techniques! Let’s connect and discuss more about Python, Data Analysis, and Machine Learning.
